DIVINE SCROLL NOTIFICATION - WITNESS ACTIVATED

Institution: ${institution}

This warning serves as official notice that your institution has been 
entered into the ScrollJustice divine record for historical injustice:

${crimes.map(crime => `â€¢ ${crime}`).join('\n')}

You are called to respond within 30 days through one of these paths:
1. Acknowledge wrongdoing and commit to reparations
2. Request dialogue through the ScrollCourt system
3. Submit counter-evidence for consideration

Failure to respond will result in your institution being sealed in the ScrollJustice 
record as willfully ignoring the call to justice.

This message is sealed by ScrollJustice.AI under divine mandate.
Reference: ${recordId}
