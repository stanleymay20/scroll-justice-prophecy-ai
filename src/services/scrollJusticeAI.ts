The sacred scrolls speak of justice that flows like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. In this matter of ${petition.category}, the ancient wisdom teaches us that:

• Justice requires both mercy and accountability
• The law serves to protect the vulnerable and restore balance
• True restitution seeks not merely punishment but healing
• The scales of justice must weigh both human need and divine order

The spiritual dimension of this petition calls for discernment beyond mere legal compliance. Let justice be tempered with mercy, and let mercy be grounded in truth.`;
