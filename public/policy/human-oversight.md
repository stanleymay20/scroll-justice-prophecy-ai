# ScrollJustice.AI - Human Oversight Policy

## Version 1.0.0 | Scroll Version: Genesis Flame | Last Updated: May 3, 2025

## Introduction

At ScrollJustice.AI, we believe that justice requires wisdom, empathy, and human judgment. While we embrace artificial intelligence and advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and accessibility, we are committed to maintaining meaningful human oversight throughout our platform.

This Human Oversight Policy outlines our fundamental commitment to ensuring that human judgment remains at the center of all critical decisions within our justice system.

## 1. Core Principles of Human Oversight

### 1.1 The Primacy of Human Judgment

We affirm that human judgment, informed by wisdom and experience, must remain the final authority in matters of justice. Technology serves to augment human capabilities, not replace human decision-making in matters of consequence.

### 1.2 The Human-in-the-Loop Model

ScrollJustice.AI operates on a human-in-the-loop model, where artificial intelligence and automation support human officials but do not autonomously make final decisions that affect users' rights or outcomes.

### 1.3 Transparency and Accountability

All automated systems and AI tools are subject to human scrutiny, with clear lines of accountability traced to specific human officials who take responsibility for decisions made with technological assistance.

### 1.4 Continuous Improvement

Our human oversight mechanisms are regularly reviewed and improved based on feedback, outcomes analysis, and evolving best practices in both judicial systems and AI governance.

## 2. Human Oversight Roles and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Flame Keepers (Human Judges)

Flame Keepers are qualified judges who serve as the primary human oversight authority within ScrollJustice.AI. They:
- Review and approve all verdicts before they are issued
- Evaluate AI-generated recommendations critically
- Apply wisdom and judgment to complex cases
- Seal final decisions with their personal authority
- Take full accountability for their decisions

### 2.2 Sacred Witnesses

Sacred Witnesses are trained officials who:
- Monitor platform operations in real-time
- Review evidence and submissions for accuracy and relevance
- Verify the identity and standing of petition participants
- Ensure procedural fairness throughout the process
- Flag cases requiring special human attention

### 2.3 Scroll Guardians

Scroll Guardians are governance experts who:
- Audit the platform's operations regularly
- Review patterns in AI recommendations for bias
- Oversee updates to AI systems and algorithms
- Ensure compliance with this Human Oversight Policy
- Report directly to the Chief Flame Keeper

## 3. Oversight of System Components

### 3.1 Petition Review and Acceptance

Every petition submitted to ScrollJustice.AI undergoes human review before formal acceptance:
- Initial AI screening for completeness and jurisdiction is performed
- A Sacred Witness reviews the AI assessment
- The petition is only accepted when approved by a human official
- Complex or unusual petitions are escalated to Flame Keepers for review

### 3.2 Evidence Evaluation

All evidence submitted through the platform is subject to human verification:
- AI tools may flag potential issues or inconsistencies
- Sacred Witnesses verify the authenticity and relevance of evidence
- Flame Keepers make final determinations on admissibility of contested evidence
- No evidence is automatically rejected without human review

### 3.3 Verdict Formulation

The process of reaching a verdict includes multiple levels of human oversight:
- AI systems may provide analysis and suggested outcomes
- Sacred Witnesses review AI analysis for factual accuracy
- Flame Keepers deliberate on the merits of each case
- **All verdicts require explicit approval from a human Flame Keeper**
- Verdicts are personally sealed by the Flame Keeper, who takes accountability

### 3.4 Appeals and Escalations

Any appeal or escalation automatically triggers enhanced human oversight:
- Appeals are always reviewed by a different Flame Keeper than the original case
- AI recommendations are given less weight in appeals proceedings
- A panel of three human Flame Keepers reviews complex appeals
- The Chief Flame Keeper personally reviews cases with significant precedential value

## 4. Prohibition of Autonomous Decision-Making

### 4.1 No Autonomous Verdicts

ScrollJustice.AI strictly prohibits autonomous AI decision-making for verdicts. All verdicts must be:
- Reviewed in their entirety by a human Flame Keeper
- Modified as necessary based on human judgment
- Explicitly approved by a human before issuance
- Sealed with the human judge's personal authority

### 4.2 No Automated Case Dismissals

The platform does not permit automated dismissal of petitions or cases:
- AI may flag potential issues for dismissal
- Only a human Flame Keeper can dismiss a case
- Dismissal requires documented justification
- Users receive notification of the human decision-maker

### 4.3 No Autonomous Sanctions or Penalties

The platform prohibits AI systems from autonomously imposing sanctions or penalties:
- All sanctions must be specifically ordered by a human Flame Keeper
- AI-suggested sanctions are considered advisory only
- Humans review the proportionality and appropriateness of all sanctions
- Implementation of sanctions requires human verification

## 5. Human Oversight Metrics and Monitoring
