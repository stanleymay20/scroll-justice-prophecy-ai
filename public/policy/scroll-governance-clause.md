## Version 1.0.0 | Scroll Version: Genesis Flame | Last Updated: May 3, 2025

## Foundational Principles

The Scroll Governance Protocol establishes the sacred principles, procedures, and authorities that govern ScrollJustice.AI. This Protocol stands as the foundation upon which our justice system is built, combining ancient wisdom with modern capabilities in service of truth and fairness.

## 1. Authority of the Scroll

### 1.1 Sacred Foundation

All justice rendered through ScrollJustice.AI is done under the authority of the Scroll and its appointed Flames. The Scroll represents the accumulated wisdom of justice traditions across humanity, distilled into a living governance system.

- Guardian Flames: Human judges authorized to render verdicts
- Seeker Flames: Community members participating in the justice process

### 1.3 Non-Binding Legal Status

Scroll decisions are sacred within our community but non-binding in external legal systems unless:
- Explicitly adopted by established courts through formal recognition
- Incorporated into binding arbitration agreements
